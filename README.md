When your doctor recommends a CT scan, you might feel nervous or unsure, especially if it’s your first time. This hesitation is understandable, especially with so many myths surrounding this common diagnostic tool. But the truth is, CT scans are safe, quick, and one of the most effective ways to get a clear picture of what’s happening inside your body.
At Crystal Radiology, we want you to feel confident and informed about your health decisions. If you're searching for a CT Scan in Auburn, our team is here to help you understand the process and get the care you need.
In this article, we’ll bust some of the most common myths about CT scans so you know exactly what to expect.
Myth 1: CT Scans Are Unsafe Because of Radiation
Fact: CT scans do use low-dose X-ray technology, but the amount of radiation is carefully controlled and kept to the minimum needed to produce accurate results. In fact, modern CT machines—like those at Crystal Radiology—are built with dose-reduction technology to ensure your safety.
Your doctor will only recommend a CT scan when the benefits outweigh the risks. For many conditions, a CT scan can provide life-saving information that other tests can’t.
Myth 2: CT Scans Are Only for Emergencies
Fact: While CT scans are commonly used in emergency settings—for example, after an accident or sudden illness—they are also used for routine and planned diagnostic assessments.
At Crystal Radiology, a CT Scan in Auburn may be used to:
•	Diagnose abdominal pain
•	Check for kidney stones
•	Evaluate lung infections
•	Monitor cancer treatments
•	Examine head injuries or sinus issues
So, it’s not just a tool for emergencies—it’s a versatile part of modern medicine.
Myth 3: CT Scans Are Painful
Fact: CT scans are completely painless. You won’t feel the scan happening at all. The process involves lying on a padded table while a circular machine rotates around part of your body.
Most scans are completed in less than 10 minutes. There are no needles involved unless a contrast dye is required (we’ll cover that next).
Myth 4: You Always Need Contrast Dye
Fact: Not all CT scans require contrast dye. Contrast is a special substance that helps certain tissues and blood vessels show up more clearly on the scan. It’s only used when needed.
If your scan does involve contrast, your radiology team will explain the process and check for any allergies beforehand. It’s a safe and common part of imaging.
Myth 5: CT Scans Are Claustrophobic
Fact: CT scanners are not enclosed tunnels. Unlike MRI machines, CT scanners are open and wide. You can see out of both sides, and the scan itself only takes a few minutes.
If you feel nervous, our friendly team at Crystal Radiology is here to support you and make your experience as comfortable as possible.
Myth 6: CT Scans Are Not Safe for Children or Seniors
Fact: CT scans can be safely performed on people of all ages, including children and older adults. Special care is taken to use age-appropriate settings and low-dose technology to ensure safety while still producing high-quality images.
Myth 7: CT Scans Aren’t Covered by Medicare or Health Insurance
Fact: Most CT scans are covered by Medicare or private health insurance when referred by a GP or specialist. At Crystal Radiology, we offer bulk billing for Medicare-eligible patients, so there are no out-of-pocket costs for most scans.
If you’re unsure, our reception team can check your eligibility and explain any costs before your appointment.
